# Opensees Resources for Beginners

Hello everyone, this github repository might be a great resources for structrual engineers, especially beginners to OpenSees with Python. 

I started learning opensees on April of 2024, and this repository includes all the codes that I've written by myself while learning the concepts of OpenSees.

**Basics covered**
- Basic intro to opensees methods
- Building fiber sections (with visualization)
- Moment Curvature Analysis
- Gravity Analysis
- Pushover Analysis
- Time History Analysis
- Building linear and non linear models
- Pounding Related Elements Verifications

**How can it be useful resources?**
- I have documented even the vary basic concept 
- Almost all of the files are written in Jupyter Notebook
- There are enough structural visualizations and responses visualizations too.
- These notes were my notes as beginner so, it will be much helpful for beginners.

**Scope and limitations**
- The structural models are only 2d models
- Some of the analysis may be incorrect *(use at your own risk)*
